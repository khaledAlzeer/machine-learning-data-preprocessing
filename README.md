📌 Machine Learning - Data Preprocessing
📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamental data preprocessing steps required before training a Machine Learning model.

Data preprocessing is a critical step in any ML workflow, as raw data often contains:

Missing values

Categorical variables

Features with different scales

This notebook applies standard preprocessing techniques using Python and Scikit-Learn.
